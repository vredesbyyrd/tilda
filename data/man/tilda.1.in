tilda \- a highly configurable terminal emulator
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBTilda\fR is a terminal emulator which is highly configurable. The main distinguishing feature of tilda is that it
uses a configurable shortcut to show and hide the tilda window. This allows users to quickly switch between tilda
and other windows only through keyboard shortcuts. When tilda is hidden it will move
outside of the screen until a shortcut is pressed again to show the tilda window. The behaviour of
tilda can be configured using the preferences dialog that is available via the context menu. A subset of the options
can also be configured from the command line as documented below.
.PP
Please note that currently command line options override the settings in the configuration file and
are persisted into the configuration file.
.PP
Tilda is currently not officially supported on Wayland. Starting with Tilda 1.5.0 it will be able to start
under Wayland but the pull hotkey will only work from other X11 windows but not when a native Wayland
window has the focus.
