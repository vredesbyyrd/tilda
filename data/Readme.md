# Tilda Man Page

The tilda man page is generated by the build system from the `tilda.1.in`
template. During the generation of the man page the version placeholder
is replaced by the current tilda version.

# Development

To make changes to the man page use the following steps:

1. Modify the template (e.g. `tilda.1.in`).
2. Build the project via `make` from the `build` dir.
3. Open the build man page via `man ./data/man/tilda.1`. This must be executed
   relative to the build directory.
